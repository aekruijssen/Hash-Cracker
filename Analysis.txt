Project 1: Password Cracking Analysis:

The first two passwords took less than a second to find.
The third took 13 seconds. Any passwords 4 characters or
longer took too long to test using the normal password
generating algorithm, but did work when fed just their hashes.
The longer the password the longer it takes to crack, since 
the program has to iterate through a lot more characters and
come up with a more complex combination, checking each along 
the way. The password cracking could be done faster through
the use of multi-proccessing. I could also have made the 
password generator more efficient. For example, I had it
so after it completed the checking of a certain number of 
characters, when it went one up (so from 3 to 4 characters),
the password iterator list reset, having to redo the first,
in this example, 3 character combos over again. To make it more
efficient, I would make it so it wouldn't redo any combos it
had already generated.
